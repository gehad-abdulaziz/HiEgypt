# HiEgypt

This project was created during my **first year at university** as part of a **team assignment**. It was my first experience working on a web project, and it helped me build a strong foundation in front-end development.

##  My Role

I was responsible for building the **Restaurant page**, which included:

- Designing **two different themes** for the restaurant section, each with a unique layout and style.
- Using **HTML** to apply all required elements and semantic structure properly.
- Styling the pages with **CSS**, ensuring a clean and organized look.
- Adding a touch of **JavaScript** to improve interactivity and user experience.
- Making the page **partially responsive** to support different screen sizes.

##  Project Goals

- Practice teamwork and task distribution within a group setting.
- Apply all essential HTML elements correctly.
- Learn how to use CSS to build real, styled layouts.
- Start exploring JavaScript basics.
- Deliver a working website that reflects Egyptian culture.

##  Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (basic usage)
- No frameworks â€“ pure front-end development

##  Responsiveness

While full responsiveness wasn't required, I made sure the Restaurant page adapts reasonably well to different screen sizes using media queries and flexible layout techniques.

##  What I Learned

- How to structure a webpage semantically
- How to build and switch between multiple themes
- Collaboration and communication within a development team
- The importance of planning before writing code
